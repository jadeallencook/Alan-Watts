                <h2>Origins of the Alan Watts Audio Project</h2>
                <p>The Alan Watts project began as the Electronic University back in 1972 when Alan Watts and his son Mark Watts were reviewing Alan's recordings for courses to create a "university without walls".

These compilations today form the core of the Essential Lecture and Eastern Wisdom collections.
